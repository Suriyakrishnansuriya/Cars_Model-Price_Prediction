# 1.Cars Model Prediction
This is a Classification dataset and need predict the Cars Model
# Data set details
1. Dataset file: ‘cars_class.csv’
2. This is a multi-class classification data set.
3. The data set has 719 samples.
4. There are 18 numerical features.
5. The target variable is the class of the car which may be one of: 0 –bus, 1 – Opel Manta, 2 – Saab, 3 – Van.
# Tasks
1. Load the data into my code 
2. Keep 20% of the data aside as test data.
3. Apply the required preprocessing techniques on the data.
4. Apply different machine learning techniques.
5. Tune the parameters of models as required.
6. Build a model named as a ‘final_model’
7. Report the following metrics using ‘final_model’ on the test data:
    # Accuracy
    # F1-score
    # Display the confusion matrix
8. And reported the importance of different features.

# 2.Cars Price Prediction
This is a Regression problem in this case need to predict the Cars Price depends on Cars features
# Data set details
1. Dataset file: ‘cars_price.csv’
2. This is a regression data set.
2. The data set has 206 samples.
3. There are 25 features.
4. The target variable is the price of the car.
# Tasks
1. Load the data into the code
2. Keep 20% of the data aside as test data.
3. Apply the required preprocessing techniques on the data.
4. Apply different machine learning techniques.
5. Tune the parameters of models as required.
6. Build a model named ‘final_model’.
7. Report the following metrics using ‘final_model’ on the test data:
    # MSE
    # MAE
    # R2-score
8. Report the importance of different features.
